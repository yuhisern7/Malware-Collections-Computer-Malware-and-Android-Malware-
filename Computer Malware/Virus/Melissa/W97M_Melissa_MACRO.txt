Infects
Machines with Microsoft Word 97 or Word 2000 
Any mail handling system could experience performance problems or a denial of service as a result of the propagation of this macro virus. 

Overview
At approximately 2:00 PM GMT-5 on Friday March 26 1999 we began receiving reports of a Microsoft Word 97 and Word 2000 macro virus which is propagating via email attachments. The number and variety of reports we have received indicate that this is a widespread attack affecting a variety of sites.
Our analysis of this macro virus indicates that human action (in the form of a user opening an infected Word document) is required for this virus to propagate. It is possible that under some mailer configurations, a user might automatically open an infected document received in the form of an email attachment. This macro virus is not known to exploit any new vulnerabilities. While the primary transport mechanism of this virus is via email, any way of transferring files can also propagate the virus.

Anti-virus software vendors have called this macro virus the Melissa macro or W97M_Melissa virus.

A virulent and widespread computer virus was found on Friday, March 26, 1999. This virus has spread all over the globe within just hours of initial discovery, apparently spreading faster than any other virus before. 
The virus, known as W97M/Melissa, spreads by e-mailing itself automatically from one user to another. The virus activates by modifying the user's documents, inserting comments from the TV series "The Simpsons". Even worse, it can send out confidential information from the computer without the user’s noticing it. 

The virus was discovered late Friday evening European time, early morning US time. For this reason, the virus spread in the USA during Friday. Many multinational companies reported widespread infections, including Microsoft and Intel. Microsoft closed down their whole e-mail system to prevent a further spreading of the virus. The number of infected computers so far is estimated at tens of thousands, and rising quickly. 

"We've never seen a virus spread so rapidly," comments Mikko Hypponen, Data Fellows' Manager of Anti-Virus Research. "We've seen a handful of viruses that distribute themselves automatically over e-mail, but not one of them has been as successful as Melissa in the real world." 

W97M/Melissa was initially distributed in an internet discussion group called alt.sex. The virus was sent in a file called LIST.DOC, which contained passwords for X-rated websites. When users downloaded the file and opened it in Microsoft Word, a macro inside the document executed and e-mailed the LIST.DOC file to 50 people listed in the e-mail alias file ("address book") of the user. 

The e-mail looked like this: 


        From: (name of infected user) 
        Subject: Important Message From (name of infected user) 
        To: (50 names from alias list) 
        Here is that document you asked for ... don't show anyone else ;-) 
        Attachment: LIST.DOC 
Do notice that Melissa can arrive in any document, not necessarily just in this LIST.DOC where it was spread initially. 
Most of the recipients are likely to open such a document attachment, as it usually comes from someone they know. 

After sending itself out, the virus continues to infect other Word documents. Eventually, these files can end up being mailed to other users as well. This can be potentially disastrous, as a user might inadvertently send out confidential data to outsiders. 

The virus activates if it is executed when the minutes of the hour match the day of the month - for example 18:27 on the 27th day of a month. At this time the virus will insert the following phrase into the current document which the user has open in Word: "Twenty-two points, plus triple-word-score, plus fifty points for using all my letters. Game's over. I'm outta here". This text, as well as the alias name of the virus author, "Kwyjibo", are references to the popular "Simpsons" cartoon TV series.

"The virus won't spread much during this weekend. We will see the real problem on Monday morning", continues Hypponen. "When a big company gets infected, their e-mail servers are seriously slowed down and might even crash, as people start to e-mail large document attachments without realising it." 
W97M/Melissa works with Microsoft Word 97, Microsoft Word 2000 and Microsoft Outlook 97 or 98 e-mail client. You don't need to have Microsoft Outlook to receive the virus in e-mail, but it will not spread itself further in e-mail without it. 

Melissa will not work under Word 95. Melissa will not spread further under Outlook Express. 

Melissa can infect Windows 95, 98, NT and Macintosh users. If the infected machine does not have Outlook or internet access at all, the virus will continue to spread locally within the user's own documents.
