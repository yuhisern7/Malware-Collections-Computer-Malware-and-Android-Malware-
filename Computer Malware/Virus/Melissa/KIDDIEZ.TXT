
Okay, so you can't program even BASIC, and you just want a copy of
the virus to play with.  Here's how:


1. Open up Microsoft Word
2. Press ALT-F11, which will pop up the VBA editor
3. In the "Project" window, you'll see "Project (Document1)".
4. Find "Microsoft Word Objects", then "ThisDocument" under that.
5. Double-click on "ThisDocument".  Delete any text that shows up
   in the editor (on the right-hand side).
6. Open Polyssa2.txt with Notepad.  From the "Edit" menu, chose
   "Select All", followed by "Copy".
7. Go back to your "Microsoft Visual Basic" window, and click
   on the right-hand window again (below where it says "(General)" or
   something at the top).  Then click "Paste".
8. Press ALT-Q to return to Microsoft Word.  Save your new document.
9. E-mail it to all your "friends".
10. Pat yourself on the back; you have successfully followed directions
    at least once in your miserable little life.
